# Coding Interview


## Clarification

Input Clarification:

* nums: interger/float, positive/negative, range, sorted, duplicates, length

* linked list: single / double

* string: lower/upper/special, length

Test Cases:

* Valid cases return True (2 ~ 3 cases)

* Valid ceses return False (2 ~ 3 cases)

* Invalid cases handling

* Edge cases
  - two input/array/matrix/val are the same
  - value zero
  - empty


## Thinking

* Solution 0: Brute force   \
  simulate human brain solving

* Solutions 1/2/..

* Data Structures needed 

* Layout the outline of the algorithm   \
  Time complexity, Space complexity

When Stuck

* Try if we can guess an answer and verify it -> Binary Search on result

* Try Segment Tree

* Try Sort

* Try convert to Graph

* Try find subproblem -> DP/recursion


## Coding

* Readability   \
  code length, e.g. 20 lines per function   \
  local variables, try avoid variable used only once   \
  self-explanatory naming

* Extendability     \
  API, e.g. top 10 -> top k 

* Maintainability
  modularize, avoid redundency


## Explain the code chunk by chunk

* Mention this is only a draft

* Explain the main logic, skip the helper method


## Run test cases

* start from a simple one 


## Optimiztion

* Coding style: variables, helper method organize


## Any question


## 1m3fdi
- Did not ask clarification question and did not perform input validation before I gave the hints.
- The solution contains duplicate code, which can be improved by reusable functions.
- Not able to reuse the solution to the part 1 when solving the part 2.
- The data structure of Interval uses List instead of a readable class and causes the solution is hard to read and error prone.
