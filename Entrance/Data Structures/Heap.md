# Heap / Priority Queue


## Overview 

Heap queue (Priority queue) doesnot support remove, while Heap supports

Time Complexity:
* Get min/max  __O(1)__

* Update  __O(logn)__

* Remove min/max  __O(logn)__

* Building (bottom up / sip down) __O(n)__

* Remove any __O(n)__


## Application

* Get min/max with removal online 

* Get kth largest online

* Get median online


## Merge K sorted arrs / liked list

- Solution 0: Brute Force   \
  Time O(nlogn) where n is the total number of nodes

- Solution 1: Use merge two sorted lists which takes O(n)   \
  merge every two for each layer    \
  Time O(nlogk)

- Solution 1+: Use merge two sorted lists which takes O(n)  \
  Divide and Conquer (top down) \
  Time O(nlogk)

- Solution 2: Heapq \
  Time: O(nlogk)
