# 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram

'''
Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.
'''


Basic idea:
  1. enumerate all possible large rectangle and get max
  2. every possible large rectangle will reach one of the tops
  3. so the idea is to get every possible rectangle according to every top
  4. for each top, find left and right first lower top than current, area=height*(right-left-1)
  5. Monotonous Stack can be used for this purpose
     - compare current one with last one in the stack
     - while current is smaller, pop stack, 
     - (thought) after all the pops, append current, then the item in the stack before current is the first smaller one in the left
     - (tricky) during the poping, current will also be the first smaller one in the right
     - so the largest rectangle based on poped = poped height * ( current_x - stack[-1]'s x)

Time O(n)
