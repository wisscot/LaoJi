# 133. Clone Graph

'''
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}

Basic idea:
Step 1: Get all old nodes (BFS / DFS)
Step 2: Clone nodes 
Step 3: Clone edges
