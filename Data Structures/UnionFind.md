# Union Find

## Overview 

Find with path compression, get amortize O(1) time

Union by rank is optional

Data stored in array or dict

   

__Good for:__

Check connectivity in Graph (online)

union, query, union, query ... 

   

__Not Good for:__

node needs to be removed from a union (delete edge)

   

## Template

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.p = list(range(n))

    def find(self, x):
        if self.p[x] != x:
            self.p[x] = self.find(self.p[x])
        return self.p[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        rootx = self.find(x)
        rooty = self.find(y)
        if rootx != rooty:
            self.p[rootx] = rooty
            # self.numBlock -= 1
```
